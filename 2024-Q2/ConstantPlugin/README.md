This program showcases a drawback of a constant (`const`) when used in a plugin-based system where assemblies are compiled dynamically.

To run the program:

-   Execute `dotnet run --project HostProgram/HostProgram.csproj`
-   Navigate to `https://localhost:7265/load-plugins`
-   Look at the console for the differences.
