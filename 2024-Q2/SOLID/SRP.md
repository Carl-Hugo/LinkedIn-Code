🔍 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Explained 🔍

Robert C. Martin once stated, "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." This foundational concept of SRP emphasizes that a class should have only one job, one responsibility, and, thus, only one reason to change.

Here’s a simple code example that violates SRP:

```csharp
public class UserManager {
  public void AddUser(string userName) { /* Add user logic */ }
  public void SendEmail(string message) { /* Email sending logic */ }
}
```

In the code above, `UserManager` handles both user management and email notifications, which are two different reasons to change. This violates SRP.

A better approach is to separate these concerns:

```csharp
public class UserManager {
  public void AddUser(string userName) { /* Add user logic */ }
}

public class EmailSender {
  public void SendEmail(string message) { /* Email sending logic */ }
}
```

💡 Takeaway:
Adhering to SRP gives each class its own distinct responsibility, enhancing the codebase's maintainability and scalability.
